# public-audit-reports-data

This repository contains urls of public security audit reports of blockchain and smart contract projects. It is updated on a weekly basis.

The scrapers are stored in a separate private repository that is going to be open sourced at some point in the future.

The list of the audit companies is taken from https://github.com/0xNazgul/Blockchain-Security-Audit-List.
